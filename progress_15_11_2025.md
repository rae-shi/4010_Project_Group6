TA Comments:
You’re positioned well. The algorithms are nearly in place, the environment is stable, and you’ve done the right work to support multi-algorithm experimentation.
For the next milestone(s), aim to have:
A. Full training runs for tabular Q-learning and DQN
Plots for:
a. average return
b. success rate
c. time-to-goal
d. sample efficiency
e. Static vs. dynamic lava comparison

Keep the environment fixed now and shift your remaining time toward experiments, analysis, and writing.
