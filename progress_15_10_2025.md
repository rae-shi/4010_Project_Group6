# Floor Is Lava — Environment Development (Weeks 1–2)

## Changes Made (since proposal submission)

### Based on TA feedback, set up the environment as follows:

**Akui Ghai**<br/>
Has been done:<br/>
    - **Action space**: Restricted to `{left(0), right(1), forward(2)}` to keep control simple and consistent with Minigrid’s orientation model<br/>
Plan:<br/>
    - **Implement RL algo**<br/>
    - **Environment demo**<br/>

**Asaad Shah**<br/>
Has been done:<br/>
    - **Environment base**: Switched from custom grid to **MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1-v0**<br/>
    - **API compatibility**: Updated all code to **Gymnasium 1.2.1 / Minigrid 3.0.0** (Farama) to follow official Gymnasium standard API <br/>
Plan:<br/>
    - **Implement RL algo**<br/>
    - **Environment demo**<br/>

**Nyman Gallie**<br/>
Has been done:<br/>
    - **Observation design**: Added `GridChannelsWrapper` → 6-channel tensor: **empty, wall, lava, goal, agent, time**<br/>
Plan:<br/>
    - **Implement RL algo**<br/>
    - **Environment demo**<br/>

**Rae Shi**<br/>
Has been done:<br/>
    - **Reward function**: Implemented `RewardShapingWrapper` with **potential-based shaping**:<br/>
        - Sparse reward (+1 at goal)<br/>
        - Step penalty (-0.01 per step)<br/>
        - Potential-based shaping (-0.02 per step)<br/>
Plan:<br/>
    - **Implement RL algo**<br/>
    - **Environment demo**<br/>

**Robert Jorge**<br/>
Has been done:<br/>
    - **Tests and Verification**: Verified installation (`minigrid==3.0.0`, `gymnasium==1.2.1`), ran `python main.py` smoke test (environment runs correctly), validated reward signals and observation tensor shape `(6, H, W)`, confirmed rendering in both `"human"` and `"rgb_array"` modes, and ensured reproducibility with fixed seed<br/>

Plan:<br/>
    - **Implement RL algo** <br/>
    - **Environment demo**<br/>



Comments from TA Oct 22nd 2025:
Well done. Keep it up. 
To do: Please rename your repo name to 4010_Project_Group6.
