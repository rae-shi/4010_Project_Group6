# Floor Is Lava — Environment Development (Weeks 1–2)

## Changes Made (since proposal submission)

### Based on TA feedback, set up the environment as follows:

**Akui Ghai**
Has been done:
    - **Action space**: Restricted to `{left(0), right(1), forward(2)}` to keep control simple and consistent with Minigrid’s orientation model
Plan:
    - **Implement RL algo**
    - **Environment demo**

**Asaad Shah**
Has been done:
    - **Environment base**: Switched from custom grid to **MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1-v0**
    - **API compatibility**: Updated all code to **Gymnasium 1.2.1 / Minigrid 3.0.0** (Farama) to follow official Gymnasium standard API 
Plan:
    - **Implement RL algo**
    - **Environment demo**

**Nyman Gallie**
Has been done:
    - **Observation design**: Added `GridChannelsWrapper` → 6-channel tensor: **empty, wall, lava, goal, agent, time**
Plan:
    - **Implement RL algo**
    - **Environment demo**

**Rae Shi**
Has been done:
    - **Reward function**: Implemented `RewardShapingWrapper` with **potential-based shaping**: 
        - Sparse reward (+1 at goal)
        - Step penalty (-0.01 per step)
        - Potential-based shaping (-0.02 per step)
Plan:
    - **Implement RL algo**
    - **Environment demo**

**Robert Jorge**
Has been done:
    - **Tests and Verification**: Verified installation (`minigrid==3.0.0`, `gymnasium==1.2.1`), ran `python main.py` smoke test (environment runs correctly), validated reward signals and observation tensor shape `(6, H, W)`, confirmed rendering in both `"human"` and `"rgb_array"` modes, and ensured reproducibility with fixed seed

Plan:
    - **Implement RL algo** 
    - **Environment demo**
